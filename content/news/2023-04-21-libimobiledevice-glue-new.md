A new helper library has been added to the project portfolio: [libimobiledevice-glue](/#download-libimobiledevice-glue).
This library contains common code that is used by the libraries and tools around the libimobiledevice project.
<!-- excerpt -->
The main functionality provided by this library are **socket** helper
functions and a platform independent **thread/mutex** implementation.
Besides that it comes with a number of string, file, and plist helper
functions, as well as some other commonly used code that was originally
duplicated in the dedicated projects.
