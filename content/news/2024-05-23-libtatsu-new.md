A new library was added to the project portfolio: [libtatsu](/#download-libtatsu).
The main purpose of this library is to allow creating TSS request payloads,
sending them to Apple's TSS server, and retrieving and processing the response.
<!-- excerpt -->
The code was originally part of **idevicerestore** and has been split out to its own library,
while obviously idevicerestore will remain the main consumer.
